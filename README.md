This is a website I built with Javascript and React framework. It is a responsive, interactive E-commerce shop. I used React Hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect) and many libraries included but not restricted to react-icons, react-responsive, Emotion. I use mockup data from a Json file which consists of 100 items, I cleaned and sorted the data as needed. With the help of a back-end developer, we were also able to test my code and deploy the website on Heroku. This project is still ongoing and I built it to this stage using only 4 days of time.
